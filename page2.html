				<h1>What are loops?</h3><br>
				<p>In Loop, the statement needs to be written only once and the loop will be executed 10 times as shown below.</p><br>
				<p>In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached.</p><br>
				<p>An operation is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, 
				and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</p><br>
				<p><b>Counter not Reached:</b> If the counter has not reached the desired number, the next 
				instruction in the sequence returns to the first instruction in the sequence and repeat it.</p><br>
				<p><b>Counter reached:</b> If the condition has been reached, the next instruction “falls through” to 
				the next sequential instruction or branches outside the loop.
